# Project Information

This project was created while the Advent Of Code 2021. Because I started solving the daily challanges, I had the idea to create a web-application off it, that provides scripts for solving the AOC. For fairness, the scripts will be added the next day after the challange was started. So everyone has a fair chance in the competition.
